Create a function close_compare that compares two numbers a and b.

When a is lower than b, return -1.

When a is higher than b, return 1.

However when a and b are the same or close within margin, return 0. Margin may not always be given.

Example: if a = 3, b = 5 and the margin is 3, since a and b are no more than 3 apart, close_compare should return 0. Otherwise, if margin is 0, a is less than b and close_compare should return -1.

Assume: margin >= 0
